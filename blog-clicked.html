							<p>New research shows that adding vanilla to certain foods can increase the perception of sweetness, reducing the need for sugar and lowering caloric intake. Everyone has unique taste buds, so to speak.</p>
							<p>It’s not just about your tongue: your DNA determines how you respond to certain flavors.</p>
							<p>For some people, the sweetness response is less intense, so they may seek out more sugar in order to feel the same level of flavor satisfaction as other people with more sensitivity to sweetness.</p>
							<p>This can lead to several serious health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
							<p class="pb-4">LifeDNA’s genetic tests can reveal your genetic preference for sweet foods. <a href="#!">Click here to learn more about how your body and brain respond to certain foods.</a></p>
							<h5 class="pt-5 fz-20">Sweetness: More than Just Sugar.</h5>
							<p>Sweetness isn’t purely dependent on the amount of sugar in food.</p>
							<p>For example, many zero-calorie sweeteners contain no sugar, yet they trigger similar responses in the brain.</p>
							<p>Pairing sugar with other flavors can also have a big impact on the amount of sugar you need to enjoy the same sweetness response.</p>
							<p>Black coffee is an obvious example: adding a small amount of sugar to coffee only reduces the perceived bitterness. You need significantly more sugar in black coffee to perceive the inherent sweetness than you would if you added sugar to water.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, we add sugar to many different foods, including coffee, cereal, oatmeal, and more.</p>
							<p>Worse yet, sugar has been added to many of the processed food items available at the store, even when you don’t expect it: pasta sauce, salad dressing, and “low-calorie” soups can all have added sugars.</p>
							<p class="pb-4">Luckily, scientists are discovering new ways to combat our sweet tooth dilemma.</p>
							<h5 class="pt-5 fz-20">The Research: We Could Lower Sugar by 20 to 50% - Without Sacrificing Sweetness.</h5>
							<p>A study from Penn State University found that <span class="text-success-2">adding vanilla to sweetened milk reduced the amount of sugar needed to achieve the same level of perceived sweetness.</span></p>
							<p>And according to their estimations, adding vanilla to common food items could reduce the need for sugar by 20 - 50%, without sacrificing flavor.</p>
							<p>That’s important, because while Americans now know that sugar is largely bad for you, it’s hard to cut back. <span class="text-success-2">Biologically speaking, sugar can be more addictive than cocaine.</span></p>
							<p class="pb-4">By reducing the amount of sugar in foods without the use of artificial sweeteners, companies may be able to offer delicious alternatives with much lower levels of sugar, thereby improving our health.</p>
							<h5 class="pt-5 fz-20">How to Use This Trick to Reduce Your Calories, Without the Hard Work.</h5>
							<p>If you often add sugar to your own foods at home, consider using vanilla extract.</p>
							<p>Based on the study’s findings, you should be able to reduce the amount of sugar you normally use by about 50% by adding a little bit of vanilla.</p>
							<p>Start with half of the normal sugar content, and slowly add more only if you feel it needs more sweetness.</p>
							<p class="pb-4">This will instantly reduce the amount of calories in your food, and it can save you from a lot of health risks down the road.</p>
							<h5 class="pt-5 fz-20">A DNA Test Can Help You Find the Optimal Diet and Weight Loss Strategies for Your Unique Body.</h5>
							<p>How you respond to certain foods and flavors is largely genetic.</p>
							<p>Should you eat low-carb, or low-fat? Do you need more Vitamin D? How will your body fat change in response to a new diet?</p>
							<p>The only way to know for sure is to get a DNA test.</p>
							<p>LifeDNA’s Health Report reveals your body’s natural response to fats, carbs, vitamins, minerals, and more.</p>
							<p>You can use this information to live a better, healthier life while achieving the body you want with less hard work.</p>
